   - **PDF Processing**: Automatically process uploaded PDFs for search and query capabilities.

### 3. **Helping Bot**
   - **Ask Questions**: Use the built-in chatbot to ask questions related to the PDFs in the selected workspace.
   - **AI-Powered Responses**: Get instant answers based on the content of the PDFs, powered by a smart AI backend.
   - **Chat History**: The bot remembers past queries and responses, allowing you to easily refer to previous interactions.

### 4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - **Interactive UI**: A clean and intuitive interface that allows you to manage workspaces, upload PDFs, and interact with the bot without hassle.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: The UI updates automatically when switching workspaces, making it easy to stay in context.

## How to Use
